# Technical Goals

- Students will learn how to record on audio tracks using a microphone.
- Students will edit overlapping clips in Arrangement View on multiple tracks.
- Students will alter audio pitch and time as needed in their project.

# Creative Goals

- Students will balance audio levels to draw attention to spoken dialogue tracks.
- Students will write an engaging, persuasive, and/or entertaining advertisement.
- Students will write a script that is easy for the listener to understand.

# Summary

Produce and record a 30 second ad for a fictional product or service.

## Script writing

Write a script for a fictional product or service. Base your ad on on a common ad structure. One common ad structure is to have a “problem person” and a “solution person.” Other ads spew a dizzying array of facts that may or may not be valid. Ads will frequently start with a question: “Do you wish that \_**\_?” “Don’t you hate it when \_\_** happens?” They will then answer the question with a product that’s for sale.

[Top Design Firms](https://topdesignfirms.com/advertising-agencies/blog/radio-ad-script) provides a great template for writing a script.

## Dialogue Recording

Once your script is written record the dialogue in the DSU studio. Use of the studio is a requirement for this project. You may not use your home studio.

Find a partner to either read your script as you run the recording session.

Record your script one line at a time to enable easier editing. Create separate tracks for each character in the ad and give the tracks appropriate names.

Use proper microphone technique for voice recording. The dialogue should be recorded at an appropriate level, but not clip. Experiment with the techniques listed in this [article](https://audient.com/tutorial/podcast-mic-technique/) on voice over recording.

## Editing

After you've recorded all your dialogue it's time to edit the recordings down so the ad fits into 30 seconds. You can do this by removing gaps between lines or even specific words where you took too long. Be sure to do this with grid snapping off.

## Sound effects

Now that your dialogue fits into 30 seconds add sound effects to liven up the ad. Listen back to our ad examples to hear what sorts of effects are commonly used to grab a listeners attention. Find sound effects on Free Sound or use your own if you have them.

## Music bed

Create a music bed to accompany the ad. Use loops if you want, or create your own piece. Remember that music is sometimes not the star of an ad, unless you're writing a jingle.

## Final mix

Now that all of your elements are in the project mix each part so that they work well together. Make sure the listeners attention is driven towards the dialogue so they know what is being sold.

## Technical requirements

1. Ad is 30 seconds long
2. Clear dialogue - Dialogue tracks recorded at appropriate level, not too low and not clipping
3. Ad also contains sound effects and music.

## Creative requirements

1.  write an engaging, persuasive, and/or entertaining advertisement.
2.  write a script that is easy for the listener to understand.

## Turn in the following

- A Reaper project that includes all of your project audio files in a subfolder called "Audio"
- A rendered wav file of your project
- the ad script
