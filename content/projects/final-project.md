Final project

Goals:

    Students will develop their projects based on their own creative vision.
    Students will synthesize multiple techniques to realize their vision.
    Students will begin to develop their own voices as artists.

Create a composition that you feel represents you as an artist. It should be 3 minutes or longer. You will use multiple techniques that we have learned through the semester to create your work. This should include:

    Recording instruments in the studio
    Sampling using those recordings
    Effects
    Automation
    MIDI Drums or percussion
    Synthesizers
        Wavetable, Frequency Modulation, or Subtractive

Each of these techniques don’t need to be the focus of the project, but need to be used in some way. For example, if you record in the studio, you can then layer in MIDI drum sounds and synthesizers that double instruments you recorded. If you do most of the composing in the DAW, record some sounds in the studio to make your composition sound more realistic.

Rule on loops: You may use 1 or 2 loops as long as they are processed beyond recognition using effects or some other technique.

Feel free to compose in whatever style you like. Do you want to include a video? No problem. Want to record a rock song? Great. Want to create an original techno track? Perfect.

Each project will be presented to the class during the final exam time: December 8th 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM.
Deliverables

Turn in a consolidated project file along with a rendered master track. Also, turn in a page long reflection on your project. A section in the beginning should cover your influences for the work, who are you listening to in order to guide this composition? How is your work different from theirs? Next you should include the steps that you went through to create the project, the problems you ran into and the solutions you came up with. Finally, cover the any future work you plan to do with the project or new projects you might want to tackle with the skills you learned on this project.

Grading: A successful project will show an understanding of the techniques we’ve learned throughout the semester and an application of those techniques towards a development of the students voice as an artist. Grading will also be based on the level of creativity and effort you put into your project.
Proposal

Due Thursday 11/18

The final project proposal should be a short description outlining the following:

    what kinds of tools you’ll be using for the final project (software (Plugins?), hardware (audio interfaces, mics, synths?))
    what kinds of sounds you’ll be using (synthesized, recorded, instruments, voice?)
    what kind of composition you’ll be creating (ambient, electronic, etc.)
