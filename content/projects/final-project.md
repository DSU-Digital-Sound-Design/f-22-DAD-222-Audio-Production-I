title: "Final Project"
---

## Goals:

- Students will develop their projects based on their own creative vision.
- Students will use multiple techniques to realize their vision.
- Students will begin to develop their own voices as artists.

Create a **3-5-minute** composition that you feel represents you as an artist. You will use multiple techniques that we have learned through the semester to create your work. This should include:

- Recording instruments or voice in the studio
  - Using the vocal/instrument recordings in your project
  - OR: Sampling using those recordings
- Effects
- MIDI Drums or percussion using ReaSamplomatic5000
- Vital Synth

If you don't want to create a musical composition mention that in your proposal and proposal something different. This could be a podcast, sound design, or some other type of audio project that shows what you've learned in this class.

Each of these techniques doesn’t need to be the focus of the project, but they need to be used in some way. For example, if you record in the studio, you can then layer in MIDI drum sounds and synthesizers that double instruments you recorded. If you do most of the composing in the DAW, record some sounds in the studio to make your composition sound more realistic.

Rule on loops: You may use one or two loops as long as they are processed beyond recognition using effects or some other technique.

Feel free to compose in whatever style you like, techno, vaproware/wave, drill-core, whatever. Do you want to include a video? No problem.

> Each project will be presented to the class during the final exam time: December 9th, 8 a.m. - 10 a.m.
> Failure to attend this exam time will result in failing the exam.

## Deliverables

Turn in a consolidated project file along with a rendered master track. Also, turn in a page long reflection on your project. A section in the beginning should cover your influences for the work, who are you listening to in order to guide this composition? How is your work different from theirs? Next you should include the steps that you went through to create the project, the problems you ran into and the solutions you came up with. Finally, cover the any future work you plan to do with the project or new projects you might want to tackle with the skills you learned on this project.

Grading: A successful project will show an understanding of the techniques we’ve learned throughout the semester and an application of those techniques towards a development of the student’s voice as an artist. Grading will also be based on the level of creativity and effort you put into your project.
