title: "Project 4: Beatmaking"
---

Create a **16 measure** musical composition using these [samples](https://dakotastateuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/tate_carson_dsu_edu/EWOvi1UXOD9Bg3vmW-a6GY0BBZMIGLCl8kdHBATbTnt2Gg?e=pGiHQc) and one or two more of your choosing.

When creating your composition gradually bring in elements and keep one thing playing the whole time. Make variations on the loops by "gluing" then "splitting" the MIDI items.

Add variations:

- Include one instance of multi-velocity sampling.
- Include one instance of round-robin sampling.

Use the production techniques we've learned so far in class to make your project sound good. This includes EQ, compression, reverb, and delay.

Do not use any audio in your timeline, only MIDI data should be used.
