title: "Project 1: Arranging Clips"
---

_Adapted from Will Kuhn, Ethan Hein - Electronic Music School_

## Technical Goals

- Students will understand basic transport and track controls in the DAW.
- Students will learn how to use the browser to find clips and place them onto tracks.
- Students will be able to add, delete, and move clips on the timeline across multiple
  tracks.

## Creative Goals

- Students will gain exposure to part layering.
- Students will begin to explore mixing parts by adjusting volume levels.
- Students will be introduced to the concept of eight-bar phrases.

Create a musical composition thirty-two bars long created entirely of loops. The purpose of this project is to spend time learning Reaper. The quality of the composition is not so important at this time. Take loops from [Looperman](https://www.looperman.com/loops) to complete your project. Ensure that none of your tracks or master channel is not clipping. Mix the volume of your loops so that each loop is intelligible.

Turn in a rendered WAV file of your project as well as a consolidated Reaper project file that includes the loops you used in your project. Zip that Reaper Project and the rendered WAV file to submit to D2L.
