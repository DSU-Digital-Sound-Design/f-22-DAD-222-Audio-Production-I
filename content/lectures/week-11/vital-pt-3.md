# Matrix and Modulation, LFO and Envelopes

## LFO

As you play any note notice that the LFO is actively moving through a triangle oscillator. It isn't having an effect yet because we need to connect it to a parameter.

Drag the LFO icon down to the cutoff frequency control of Filter 1. Now notice that you can control this cutoff frequency parameter with the LFO. Notice the circle that now connects the two parts of the synth. This allows you to change the amount of modulation. You can also think of this as the _strength_ of the modulation. Now experiment with the frequency of the LFO.

As with our audible oscillators, we're not limited to basic oscillator shapes for our LFOs. Experiment with some of the other oscillator shapes that can give the sound a more rhythmic quality.

Currently, our modulation only acts in a positive direction, from the start of the parameter upward. We can change that and modulate +/- from our starting position by right clicking on the amount icon and choosing "make bipolar."

> All of these options can be more clearly seen in the matrix tab. Click on that now.
