- musical instrument digital interface
- connects devices together to exchange information like pitch and volume
- allows for keyboards and controllers to manipulate a DAWs faders and knobs
- allows for a DAW to control hardware audio processors and synthesizers
- MIDI spec - describes hardware and messages
- hardware
  - cables, ports, computer interfaces, and various electrical details that allow for the communication of musical data between synthesizers, computers, and various other electronic musical devices.
- messages
  - what information can be communicated between such connected devices and what form the messages take.

# MIDI Hardware

## A brief history of MIDI

## Analog Days: Synthesizers in the 1960s and 1970s

- Robert Moog, Donald Buchla, and others
  - analog
  - modular
  - voltage controlled

{{% note %}}

- analog
  - electrical signals in the synths consisted of continuous changes in electrical voltage rather than a discrete series of numbers as in modern digital synthesizers.
- modular
  - the task of generating sound was distributed among separate hardware units called modules.
  - oscillators, filters, and amplifiers were separate modules.
- voltage controlled
  - keyboards, joysticks, and ribbon controllers were used to send control voltages to the modules to change their settings.

{{% note %}}

- in the 1970s digital control in the form of sequencers was added to analog synthesizers to allow for more precise control.
- they also added the ability to save settings, the original presets
- this is a Sequential Circuits Model 800 that could hook up to any synthesizer through voltage control
- Eventually all digital synthesizers were developed

Yamaha DX7, an early all-digital, MIDI-compatible keyboard synthesizer (1983). At about $2,000, the DX7 was relatively inexpensive by early 1980s’ standards.

## MIDI 1.0 Specification

- synth manufacturers wanted to create a communications standard
- MIDI 1.0 Specification - published in 1983
- first connections at NAMM - Sequential Circuits Prophet 600 and a Roland JP-6.

## Controllers

[Various controllers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=midi+controllers&t=newext&atb=v265-1&iax=images&ia=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fimages%2Fimages2500x2500%2Flivid_instruments_lvbase02_multipurpose_performance_controler_for_1054583.jpg)

{{% note %}}

- only sends MIDI messages
- doesn't generate sound on its own
- before personal computers it would send messages to a hardware synth but now we connect them to computers

## Modules - Roland Fantom-XR

<img src="roland-fantom-xr.jpg" width="60%">

{{% note %}}
A module is a device that can generate sound when it receives MIDI messages but has no keys to play, and hence can’t output MIDI messages.
