Install [Vital Synth](https://vital.audio/#getvital) (basic)

Spend a few minutes loading presets and hearing all the capabilities of Vital.

## Create a new patch

Now go and reinitialize the preset to start from scratch.

The first thing you may notice is the sawtooth wave. If you click on the arrows you can choose between many different wave shapes, each with a different tone color.

Also, try moving the position slider to the right. This scans through the wavetable to give you even more wave shapes to choose from.

You can also change the pitch and tuning of the oscillator. This becomes more interesting as we add in another oscillator in a later lesson.

Look below now where it says _filter 1_. This routes the oscillator into a filter. Currently the filter is greyed out, but if you click on the dot you can turn it on. This filter has many more settings than the ReaEQ because it is mean to color the sound, not just for mixing.

Then we can play around with the unison section, adding more voices and spreading them out. Then finally the spectral morph and wave morph sections.

Also, notice the amplitude envelope on the right. This is similar to what we've been using with the Learning Synths examples but here they've added two new features: _hold_ and _delay_. Change them and listen to how the sound changes.
