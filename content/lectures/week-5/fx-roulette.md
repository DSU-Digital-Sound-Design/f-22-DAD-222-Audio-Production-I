<!-- Password to edit randomizer is "reaper" -->

- Tools - [Timer](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/eggtimer-countdown/full-screen/), [FX Randomizer](https://www.classtools.net/random-name-picker/41_kAdkRk)
- First add all of the effects on the wheel to your project. They can be on different tracks. Make sure the effects are deactivated, or unchecked. Don't worry, you can move the effects to other tracks later if you want.
- We will have 7 rounds of varying lengths of time, each round add the chosen effect to your project. You'll have until the timer buzzes to play with the effect and hear what it can do.
- As an effect is chosen with the random wheel activate it and explore its effect on your track.
- The rounds timed like this:
  - Round 1: five minutes
  - Round 2: four minutes
  - Round 3: three minutes
  - Round 4: two minutes
  - Round 5: one minute
  - Round 6: 30 seconds
  - Round 7: 15 seconds
- After this is done we'll spend 5 more minutes and you can turn on the effects that you like to try to get a sound you're happy with.
- Then finally we'll listen to each of your compositions in class to see what you came up with. What effects did you like the best? The least? Were there effects that you were confused by?
