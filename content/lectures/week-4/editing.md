If you need to undo you can click "cmd + z". Or if you want to see a full undo history go to the undo history under Edit -> Undo History. You can now see which actions you took and go back to the state you want.

Hold down alt and drag on an item to adjust it's content timing without moving the item.

To split an item place your cursor where you want to split and type "S". This allows you to deal with the item in smaller chunks, or to delete parts you don't want. If you want to undo the splits you made you can heal the item. Under the item menu select "Heal splits in items". This is different from glue, which allows you to connect any items. Heal only heals splits that you made within an item.

Notice that if you move one item over another it starts to create a crossfade. This is a desired action, as it fades between one item and the next. This helps to remove discontinuities between the items such as clicks or pops. We generally want this crossfade to be very small.

All of the same principles works when you have multiple items on different tracks. Duplicate your track two more times and select all of the items by right click dragging.

## Razor editing

Razor editing is an alternative to splitting an item multiple times to delete content. Hold down the "alt" key and right-click drag to make your razor edits. You can make razor edits on one or multiple tracks. Razor edits are sort of like temporary items. You can do everything to it that you can do to a normal item.

Once you make your razor edit selection you can expand or contract the selection the same way you can trim an item.

Make multiple razor edits by typing "alt + shift + right-click drag".
