# Week 1 (8/22)

## Monday

- Class introductions
  - What's your name, major, and where are you from?
- Introduction to [syllabus](../syllabus)
- [Intro to Music Technology](../lectures/week-1/intro-to-music-tech-slides/) slides
- [Pre-test](https://d2l.sdbor.edu/d2l/le/content/1725928/viewContent/10642341/View) - answer a few questions so I know what you already know.

## Wednesday

- The pre-test results were promising. You know a few things already.
  - If you haven't completed this, let's spend a few minutes and do it in class.
- [Sound and hearing](../lectures/week-1/sound-and-hearing/) slides
<!-- - [What is sound?](x-devonthink-item://07E680A4-DDDA-4630-AC76-FDBA898D69B8) -->

> **Homework - Due Friday**: Post a recording or video of one of your favorite songs or pieces of music that involve some type of audio production. Find some aspects of the piece that you would like to learn how to recreate in this class. Write a paragraph describing why you like it and what you would like to learn from it.
> Submit both to D2L

## Friday

- Listen to a few of your songs

<!-- ## Friday

**Introduction to Reaper**

- Introduction to Reaper
  - DAW Basics - Timeline

  - Explain BPM, and Key
  - make sure grid and snap are enabled
  - drag clips into the timeline
  - Set your BPM to the tempo of the first clip you import
  - two melodic parts may sound good together, but it will depend on the key
  - remove unwanted items
    - to delete part of an item you can split the item twice then delete the part you don't want. You can make this process quicker by making a time selection and then "split items at time selection" (Shift+S).
  - remove unused tracks
  - Loop timeline and toggle repeat to repeat a whole section
  - make loop longer or shorter - double click on item and make sure that "loop source" is selected. Pull on the bottom corner to lengthen the loop
  - If the loop you find is not the correct BPM then shift the time with Reaper. Hold **Option** and click in the bottom right corner then drag to the desired length. -->

  - Book your time in the studio to record your projects - we will also spend some time Monday doing projects

# Week 4 (9/12)

## Monday

- Record during class time if you haven't booked time yet.
- Editing
  - Each student must edit their own commercial.
  - More tips for editing in Reaper
    - [Editing](../lectures/week-4/editing/)
  - Eliminate empty space between lines to get the "fast talking" effect of a radio ad.
  - Demonstrate zooming into the waveform to more easily see silences.
  - ripple editing
  - Add fades between edits if they're not automatically there.
  - condense your ad to be 30 seconds long.

## Wednesday

- [Digital Audio](../lectures/week-4/digital-audio-data/)
- More recording in class if necessary
- Reminder about razor editing with ripple mode - very useful for cutting out silence and speeding up dialogue
- Create two folders for your sound effects and music. This way you can have control over the mix of your dialogue, sfx, and music independently.
- Sound Effects + music beds
  - [Finding sound effects](../lectures/week-4/sound-effects/)
  - Listen back to the ads from a few classes ago, what types of sound effects do they use?
  - Examples could be transition impacts or swooshes between character lines. Some scripts will have specific needs for effects that illustrate locations or products, like chirping birds for outdoor settings.
  - Add sound effects to separate tracks
  - make sure your music and dialogue work well together, listen to the examples for how the dialogue is timed to the music
- mixing - background music should be much quieter than dialogue, around -30 dB is a good start.

## Friday

- Listen to the ads in class
- Catch up time for any behind students

> Project 2: Unreliable Product Ad DUE

# Week 5 (9/19)

- What happens when two tracks are in a piece of music and share the same frequency range?
- Do this basic music mix - [download](https://mtkdata.cambridgemusictechnology.co.uk/MTK005/cfx_Mathematician.zip)
  - set the levels so that nothing is clipping and everything can be heard easily
  - find the tracks that still can't be heard, what other tracks are masking those?
  - Add an equalizer to the masking track to try to "carve" out a space for the other track to be heard
  - i'll do a mix in class and you try to recreate it as closely as you can

## Friday

- Continue with mix from Wednesday
  - Build mix with volume levels
  - add EQ to help with masking
