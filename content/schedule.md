# Week 1 (8/22)

## Monday

- Class introductions
  - What's your name, major, and where are you from?
- Introduction to [syllabus](../syllabus)
- [Intro to Music Technology](../lectures/week-1/intro-to-music-tech-slides/) slides
- [Pre-test](https://d2l.sdbor.edu/d2l/le/content/1725928/viewContent/10642341/View) - answer a few questions so I know what you already know.

## Wednesday

- The pre-test results were promising. You know a few things already.
  - If you haven't completed this, let's spend a few minutes and do it in class.
- [Sound and hearing](../lectures/week-1/sound-and-hearing/) slides
<!-- - [What is sound?](x-devonthink-item://07E680A4-DDDA-4630-AC76-FDBA898D69B8) -->

> **Homework - Due Friday**: Post a recording or video of one of your favorite songs or pieces of music that involve some type of audio production. Find some aspects of the piece that you would like to learn how to recreate in this class. Write a paragraph describing why you like it and what you would like to learn from it.
> Submit both to D2L

## Friday

- Listen to a few of your songs

<!-- ## Friday

**Introduction to Reaper**

- Introduction to Reaper
  - DAW Basics - Timeline

  - Explain BPM, and Key
  - make sure grid and snap are enabled
  - drag clips into the timeline
  - Set your BPM to the tempo of the first clip you import
  - two melodic parts may sound good together, but it will depend on the key
  - remove unwanted items
    - to delete part of an item you can split the item twice then delete the part you don't want. You can make this process quicker by making a time selection and then "split items at time selection" (Shift+S).
  - remove unused tracks
  - Loop timeline and toggle repeat to repeat a whole section
  - make loop longer or shorter - double click on item and make sure that "loop source" is selected. Pull on the bottom corner to lengthen the loop
  - If the loop you find is not the correct BPM then shift the time with Reaper. Hold **Option** and click in the bottom right corner then drag to the desired length. -->

# Week 3 (9/5)

## Monday

Labor Day - No Class

## Wednesday

[Project 2: Unreliable Product Ad](x-devonthink-item://08C7ECF5-1232-4BC2-B405-60B8A4F5BFC4?section=recordingtechniques) - DUE 9/16

- Listen to some ads - TODO: find ads
  - Describe how the announcers voice sounds. How many tracks were needed? How was the ad written? What is the form?
  - How long is a typical ad? How long do you think the script needs to be to match?
  - Let's try to find some common forms between these ads. One might be "problem person" and a "solution person". Or "Do you wish that X could happen?"
- Split the students up into groups of 2 or 3 - the group part is just to give them help with recording. Students will edit, add sound effects and music for their own projects.
- Start Writing scripts in class
  - Suggestions - unnecessary kitchen gadget, pharmaceutical product with a suspiciously long list of side effects
  - Have at least part of your script written by Friday because we'll be starting our recordings then.

## Friday

- Studio visit - identify hardware we talked about in class - demonstrate how to do a simple voice recording
  - Get different students to run the session - have them record part of their add to get them started with the the project. Get them to finish the project by booking studio time. Record individual lines
  - Demonstrate arming tracks and recording, getting good levels
  - Microphone technique
  - See: [Recording and Processing Voiceover or Narration in REAPER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTNo3yrWGww)

# Week 4 (9/12)

## Monday

- Editing
  - Each student must edit their own commercial.
  - More tips for editing in Reaper
    - [Editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yTQ-31opp8&t=462s)
  - Eliminate empty space between lines to get the "fast talking" effect of a radio ad.
  - Demonstrate zooming into the waveform to more easily see silences.
  - Demonstrate this by recording myself saying a few lines then condensing it down to 15 seconds by eliminating pauses. Do this using ripple editing mode and razor edits.
  - Add fades between edits if they're not automatically there.
  - condense your ad to be 30 seconds long.

## Wednesday

- Sound Effects + music beds
  - Finding sound effects - freesound.org, Soundly
  - Add sound effects to separate tracks
  - mixing - background music should be much quieter than dialogue, around -30 dB is a good start.

## Friday

- Listen to the ads in class
- Catch up time for any behind students

> Project 2: Unreliable Product Ad DUE

# Week 5 (9/19)

## Monday

**Effects**

- In-class lesson: FX Roulette (Beginner) adam patrick bell - The Music Technology Cookbook (p. 245)
  - Take your loop compositions from the first project, or if you want create a new project with different loops.
  - Add all of the effects on this list to one of your tracks and uncheck them so they are not active.
  - As an effect is chosen with the random wheel activate it and explore its effect on your track.
  - The rounds timed like this:
  - Round 1: five minutes Round 2: four minutes Round 3: three minutes Round 4: two minutes Round 5: one minute Round 6: 30 seconds Round 7: 15 seconds
  - After this is done we'll spend 5 more minutes and you can turn on the effects that you like to try to get a sound you're happy with.
  - Then finally we'll listen to each of your compositions in class to see what you came up with. What effects did you like the best? The least? Were there effects that you were confused by?
  - Submit your rendered project to D2L.

## Monday

- Music Concrete Introduction
  - What is musique concrète? Where did it begin? Who are its pioneers? What is “concrete” about it? Why doesn’t it use conventionally-produced instrumental sounds? What does “étude” mean? Why do we limit ourselves to a sound lasting a few seconds? How can you wring as much expression out of it as possible?
